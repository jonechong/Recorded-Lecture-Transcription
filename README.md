# Recorded-Lecture-Transcription
This repository focuses on the development of a recorded lecture transcription system.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a transcription tool that converts speech from lecture videos into text. This tool is aimed at enhancing accessibility for students who benefit from written materials, such as those with hearing impairments, non-native speakers, and those who prefer textual learning aids. Adding punctuation to the transcripts is a secondary objective, dependent on project timelines and resources, aimed at further improving the readability of the transcribed text.

## Expected Input & Output
Input: Audio tracks extracted from lecture videos

Primary Output: A text transcript of the audio content
Secondary Output: Primary output, but with punctuations

## Dataset
Our primary dataset will be the Common Voice dataset by Mozilla. We will focus only on the English Language.

## Content
There are 3 main submodules in this repository:
1) A monolithic GUI submodule
2) A Speech-To-Text model development submodule
3) A punctuation restoration model development submodule

The details for each development will be in the readme of the submodules

## Instructions

Wait for completion!
